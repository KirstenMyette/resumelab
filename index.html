    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div class="about">
        <p class="left"> Once upon a time, I was born in California. Due to the weather pattern "El Nino" my family was compelled to move
            to the small town of Harrisonville, Missouri in 1999. I played volleyball and softball and had enough skill and
            potential to possibly get a scholarship one day and attend a four year college. However fate is fickle and due
            to my mothers' third husband getting a job at UAB, we were once again relocated to good ol Birmingham, Alabama.
        </p>
        <p class="right">It was here that I attented Oak Mountain High School and graduated in 2008 (just barely). Since then I have been
            working at several low wage jobs that just didn't cut it. I heard about Innovate Birmingham through a good friend
            of mine who saw a story on the local news. She encouraged me to sign up and through perseverence I was accepted.
